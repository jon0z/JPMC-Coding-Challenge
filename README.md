# JPMC-Coding-Challenge

### Objective: 
Create a native app to provide information on NYC High Schools 

### Requirements:
1. Display list of NYC High Schools
    1. Get your data from: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/s3k6-pzi2

2. Selecting a school from the list should show additional information about the school
    1. Display  all the SAT scores - include Math, Reading and Writing
        1. Get SAT data from: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/f9bf-2cp4
    2. It is up to you to decide what additional information to display

### What is important?
- Meet basic App requirements.
- The App should work like it would do in productin - error handling, edge conditions, stability 
and speed are important.
- Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds made in the interest of expediency).
- Proper architecture with separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
- Modern asynchronous programming techniques.
- Use Kotlin as primary language.

### Bonus Points!
- Good use of UX and UI
- Samples of unit testing
- Additional functionality - whatever you see fit


The app requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details were omitted, it was because we will be happy
with any of a wide variety of functional solutions. Feel free to be creative and impress with code and UX. 
You are allowed to use all the online resources you can find and use any 3rd party library, if desired. 
**Remember to make the app useful for an actual user/student**
